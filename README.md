👋 Hi, I’m @chimpytuts, a fullstack developer in web3 and the CTO of D3, a software company. I have been programming since I was 12 years old and love taking on challenges.

👀 I’m interested in exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with web3. I'm also passionate about creating software that is easy to use, efficient, and secure.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about blockchain (EVM) technology, as well as deepening my knowledge of front-end development and UX design.

💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on interesting projects, especially those related to web3 or decentralized applications. If you have an idea or a project you'd like to work on together, feel free to reach out to me.

📫 You can reach me on Telegram at @chimpytuts. I'm always open to new conversations and ideas, so don't hesitate to say hi!
